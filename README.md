# Archipelago Manual for Super Street Fighter 2

**Version 0.6.0**

## Welcome!
Welcome to the official repository for the Archipelago integration manual for Super Street Fighter 2. This manual is a community‑driven effort to enhance the gaming experience by linking various elements and goals across games in the Archipelago system. Currently, the randomizer is based on the Super Nintendo (SNES) version of the game. Other versions will be reviewed later to ensure compatibility of all checks, since some modes—like Time Challenge—may not be available everywhere. Hooks support will also be added in the future to improve the YAML integration.

## Project Status
This project has completed its **Alpha** phase and is now in **Beta**. It is fully functional, with many optimizations and additional features underway. Your feedback and contributions remain invaluable for improving the manual and resolving any issues. Each Beta release is tested at least once before being pushed to GitHub. However, no system is infallible, so please report any bugs or inconsistencies.

## Current Features
- **Super Battle Mode – ALL CLEARS**: Complete Super Battle Mode with every character.  
- **Street Fighter Token**: Collect tokens scattered throughout the game.  
- **Time Challenge Mode – ALL CLEARS**: Defeat every opponent in Time Challenge Mode.  
- **ALL CLEARS + TOKENS**: Fulfill all objectives and gather all tokens.

## Future Features (not guaranteed)
- Add character‑specific special moves into the item pool.  
- Require winning at least one round for each special move check.
